Since September 2020 I'm Guest Professor of Econometrics at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Before I worked as a postdoc in the econometrics group at the University of Helsinki. I obtained my PhD from the University of Göttingen in 2017.

I'm interested in econometrics, sustainability and what holds the world together. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments on my research or the implementation in R!
